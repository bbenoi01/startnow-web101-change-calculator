Welcome! 
Thank you for visiting my Change Calculator. As the title implies, this is just a simple program to break down change. It will take two inputs, amount due and amount received and the output the change amount in the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies to be given back.

How to open:
Using your command prompt, enter 'code ~/oca/startnow-web101-change-calculator' and press enter, to open the project in visual studio code. To test the application, run static.
